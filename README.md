# springboard_capstone_one
  This repository exists to collect documents for my first capstone project in the Springboard Data Science Career Track. 

  Problem:    
  Can emails be used to identify the author's gender?

  Dataset:    
  Enron email corpus

  Approach:    
  Identify a set of emails where each email can be associated with the â€‹Gender of the author for the learning set. Create a model that predicts the gender of input emails. 

  Please Note: Due to the large size of most data files used in this project, I am unable to upload them. However, I've listed the URL used to download the email dataset in the project for convenience.
