Such GISB is referenced in the current draft Netting Agreement currently under AEP's review.  (2) The wholesale power trading masters identified and referenced in the current draft Netting Agreement are a Power Sales Agreement dated as of September 29, 1997  providing for sales of wholesale electric power by EPMI to AEP, and a Service Agreement dated as of March 30, 1998 under the AEP Companies' Wholesale Market Tariff, providing for sales of wholesale electric power by AEP to EPMI.  (3) You indicated below that ENA trades (using GTCs) physical coal and physical synfuel with American Electric Power Service Corporation.  These relationships would be pulled in by the Master Netting Agreement's catch-all Recital defining \"Other Agreements\"  unless Credit determines with AEP that these trading relationships are to be excluded, and language is added to that effect. -  David  \n",

The best news is that she was a very chatty individual and was interested in our thoughts on the questions.  I told her that our answer no. 1 was just going to confirm that the recourse rate is in fact in our tariff where it is supposed to be and it is always \"offered.\"  I suggested that her question no. 1 was a little different and to me, indicated that FERC just didn't understand the daily markets at all and further didn't understand very much about index to index deals and how they might be the best way to contract in many circumstances.  She took that bait and said that their answer would focus on exactly that--that fixed rate deals create risk issues for trading companies that index deals lay off.  She also said that FERC's questions looked similar to questions Sempra Trading has had to answer on other deals and that she thought her answer would be similar.  I got a high comfort level that she viewed this whole thing as no big deal.  Are any of you aware of where Sempra may have been required to answer questions like these???
